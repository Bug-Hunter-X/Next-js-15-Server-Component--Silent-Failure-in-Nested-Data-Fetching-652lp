In Next.js 15, an uncommon error arises when using server components with a complex data fetching hierarchy.  Suppose you have a server component that fetches data from multiple API endpoints, and one of these endpoints fails.  If error handling isn't carefully implemented within the nested fetches, the error might be swallowed, leading to silent failures or unexpected behavior in the client component.
