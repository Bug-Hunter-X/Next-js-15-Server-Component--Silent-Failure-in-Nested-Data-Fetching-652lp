The solution involves adding comprehensive error handling at each stage of the data fetching process.  Use `try...catch` blocks to catch errors, and explicitly handle them, providing appropriate fallback mechanisms.  Consider logging the error for debugging and potentially returning an error state or a default value to gracefully handle failures.  The client component should then be updated to manage these potential error states.
